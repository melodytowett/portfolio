               <h4>Why I Took Programmimg</h4>
               <p>When growin up I never had an opportunity to interact with a computer.One day my uncle came home with his laptop and 
                   it looked something so preciouse and I became curiouse to know what it does and how it works.
                   This made me want to persue soemthing that relates to cumputers and thats how I researched and found out about programming
                   My passion and purpose  to be a programmer grew ever since then.
